# Github-Collaboration-Network-Analysis
## Project Overview
The GitHub Collaboration Network project explores how open-source contributors interact within the GitHub ecosystem. Using GitHub's REST API, the project builds a collaboration graph where each node represents a GitHub user, and an edge signifies that two users have contributed to the same repository. The network is then analyzed using various graph-theoretic metrics to uncover influential contributors, hidden communities, and the overall structural properties of collaboration on GitHub.

## üéØ Objective
- To extract data from GitHub using its public API based on a chosen keyword (e.g., "network science", "data science").


- To construct a collaboration graph representing contributor relationships across repositories.


- To analyze the graph using centrality measures and clustering techniques.


- To visualize the network to reveal patterns in collaboration and influence.



## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools Used
- Python


- GitHub REST API ‚Äì for repository and contributor data


- NetworkX ‚Äì for graph construction and analysis


- Matplotlib ‚Äì for visualization




## üîç Key Features
- Data Collection:


Uses GitHub‚Äôs Search API to find repositories by topic.


Retrieves contributors for each repository.


- Graph Construction:


- Nodes: GitHub users.


- Edges: Co-contribution to the same repository.


Edge weights represent the number of shared collaborations.


- Network Analysis:


- Degree Centrality, Betweenness, Closeness, and Eigenvector Centrality.


- Community detection via Louvain modularity.


- Visualization:


Spring layout visualization of collaboration structure.


Node sizes proportional to centrality.


- Export Options:


Save the network in GraphML or GEXF formats for external tools (e.g., Gephi).



## üìà Insights & Questions Explored
- Which contributors are most central to the collaboration ecosystem?


- Do dense clusters indicate specialized sub-communities or domain experts?


- How does network structure change when filtering low-weight edges?


- Does the resulting graph resemble known network models like scale-free or small-world networks?



## üß© Extensions & Future Work
- Increase scale: Analyze hundreds of repositories using pagination and rate-limit handling.


- Time-based analysis: How do collaborations evolve over time?


- Incorporate additional metadata: Programming languages, commit frequency, geographic data.


- Deploy an interactive dashboard using Dash or Streamlit for real-time exploration.



## üìå Conclusion
This project bridges data acquisition, graph theory, and visualization to understand how developers collaborate in open-source ecosystems. It provides valuable insights into network dynamics and offers a scalable framework for further research into software engineering and social coding networks.
